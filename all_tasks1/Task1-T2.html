                Dr.-Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG, usually shortened to Porsche AG (German pronunciation: (About this soundlisten); see below), is a German automobile manufacturer specializing in high-performance sports cars, SUVs and sedans. Porsche AG is headquartered in Stuttgart, and is owned by Volkswagen AG, which is itself majority-owned by Porsche Automobil Holding SE. Porsche's current lineup includes the 718 
                Boxster/Cayman, 911, Panamera, Macan, Cayenne and Taycan. 
                Ferdinand Porsche founded the company called "Dr. Ing. h. c. F. Porsche GmbH" in 1931, with main offices at Kronenstra√üe 24 in the centre of Stuttgart. Initially, the company offered motor vehicle development work and consulting, but did not build any cars under its own name. One of the first assignments the new company received was from the German government to design a car for the people, that is a "Volkswagen". This resulted in the Volkswagen Beetle, one of 
                the most successful car designs of all time. The 
                Porsche 64 was developed in 1939 using many components from the Beetle.
